# Classical Chinese Flashcards

This is a flashcard app for the vocabulary in Bryan Van Norden's [Classical 
Chinese for 
Everyone](https://hackettpublishing.com/classical-chinese-for-everyone). I 
wrote it to help myself learn the material and I hope it will assist others in 
doing the same.

Lesson numbers in the app's settings correspond to the lessons of the book. I 
am updating the vocab as I work through it.

## Contributing

If you are just interested in updating the vocab, all of that is located in 
`data/wordlist.ts`.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with 
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), 
and can be run locally using

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

# Classical Chinese Flashcards

This is a flashcard app for the vocabulary in Bryan Van Norden's [Classical 
Chinese for 
Everyone](https://hackettpublishing.com/classical-chinese-for-everyone). I 
wrote it to help myself learn the material and I hope it will assist others in 
doing the same.

## Filtering

You can filter vocabulary using the "Filters" drawer at the bottom of the 
screen. Flashcards will be included if they match _any_ selected filter in 
_all_ filter categories (lessons, types, etc.). Lesson numbers correspond to 
the lessons of the book.

"Apply Filters" will apply updated filters to the remaining words without 
changing your progress. "Reset Cards" will clear your progress and apply 
updated filters to a fresh set of characters.

## Using with Pleco

If you prefer to use [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/) as your flashcard app, you 
can download a compatible flashcard text file from 
[/cc4e-flashcards.txt](https://classical-chinese-flashcards.netlify.app/cc4e-flashcards.txt)
and import it with the Pleco app. 

## Contributing

If you are just interested in updating the vocab, all of that is located in 
`data/wordlist.ts`.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with 
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), 
and can be run locally using

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
